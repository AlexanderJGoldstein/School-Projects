# Instructions  

The purpose of this lab is to write a doubly linked list class. The `Link.java` class represents a node in the list. You will complete the missing code in `DoubleList.java` so that we then will have an abstract list class that we can simply call `add`, `remove`, etc. on and also use an iterator. 

Complete the unfinished iterator methods in `DoubleList.java` so that they satisfy the requirements of the [Iterator Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html).

Also, implement the following methods in `DoubleList.java`:  

- `add(int index, E item)`
- `remove(int index)`
- `reverse()`

You may test your code using the `DoubleListDriver.java` class and the JUnit test cases that are being used for grading. 

Please note: I am aware that solutions to this lab exist on the internet and I will know if you simply copy and paste the answers without understanding.
